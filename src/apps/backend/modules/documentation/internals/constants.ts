export const DOCUMENTATION_GENERATION_PROMPT =
  'Generate a detailed API documentation in a human-readable bullet pointed format with proper spacing and indentation for the routes provided. The documentation should include the following for each route: a clear description, endpoint, HTTP method, request body parameters (with all possible variations stated clearly in sections with proper titles), and response status code & body parameters. Ensure that the request and response bodies are presented as properly formatted JSON objects, using accurate variable names as defined in the serializers and/or response type definitions. Also make sure to categorize the routes into sections with proper titles. Return the documentation as a markdown file, without any additional text or comments like adding ```markdown at the beginning or at the end. Add an underlines b/w each route of the section like (---) in the generated markdown file.';
