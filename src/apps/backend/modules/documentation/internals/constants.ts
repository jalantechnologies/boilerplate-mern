export const DOCUMENTATION_GENERATION_PROMPT =
  'Generate a detailed and accurate API documentation in a human-readable bullet pointed markdown format with proper spacing and indentation for the routes provided. The documentation should include the following for each route: a clear description, endpoint, HTTP method, request body parameters (with all possible variations stated clearly in sections with proper titles), and response status code & body parameters. Ensure that the request and response bodies attributes are accurately defined, using variable names as defined in the service method parameter of controller method incase of request and serializers incase of response. Make sure to include only the variable names in the request and response bodies, not the types or other details. Also make sure to categorize the routes into sections with proper titles. Return the documentation as a markdown file, without any additional text or comments like adding ```markdown at the beginning or at the end. Add underlines b/w each route of the section like (---) in the generated markdown file, but not under the title of the section or under the last route of the section.';
