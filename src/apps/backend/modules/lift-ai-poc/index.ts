## Rules for Evaluation:

1. **Account Health Status**:
   - Condition: If {{ WARNED }} is a WARNED or CRITICAL, it should be considered as unhealthy and a task should be created in teamworks.

2. **Pre-Fulfillment Cancellation Rate**:
   - Condition: If {{ 0.025001 }} is greater than {{ 0.025 }}, a task should be created in teamworks, else no need to create a task for this.

3. **Order Defect Rate**:
   - Condition: If {{ 0.011 }} is greater than {{ 0.01 }}, a task should be created in teamworks, else no need to create a task for this.

4. **Valid Tracking Rate**:
   - Condition: If {{ 0.90004 }} is less than {{ 0.95 }}, a task should be created in teamworks, else no need to create a task for this.

5. **Late Shipment Rate**:
   - Condition: If {{ 0.04001 }} is greater than {{ 0.04 }}, a task should be created in teamworks, else no need to create a task for this.
